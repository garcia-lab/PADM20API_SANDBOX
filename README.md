# PADM20API_SANDBOX

Chances are you're reading this because you're interested in Tripp Lite's PADM 20 platform and our new RESTful API. Nothing you find here will be ready for production use as-is, but you may find some useful examples or docs that help. Feel free to reach out to me directly if you have questions. 

With that out of the way, below is a running list of what I have going.

Some basic examples here on Postman:

A Python script that takes user input and uses that to login, read info on load 1, and turn load 1 off:
